## Merchant of Record Resource Page
- **Title**: "Polar as a Merchant of Record"

### Table of Contents
- Introduction
- PSP vs. MoR
- International Sales Tax

### Introduction
**What is a Merchant of Record?**
"We take on the liability of international sales taxes globally for you. So you can focus on growing your business vs. accounting bills. Leave billing infrastructure and international sales tax headaches to us."

### Payment Service Providers (PSPs)
**Description**: "Stripe and other Payment Service Providers (PSPs) offer an accessible and convenient abstraction to faciliate transactions on top of underlying credit card networks & banks."

**Pros**:
- Powerful, flexibile & low-level APIs to facilitate transactions
- Can be used to power all business- and pricing models under the sun.

**Cons**:
- You are responsible for all liabilities associated with transactions, e.g international taxes
- Low-level APIs require more development even for common use cases

### Merchant of Record
**Description**: "Merchants of Record offer yet another layer of convenient abstraction to facilitate digital orders on top of the underlying PSPs and transactions."

**Pros**:
- Powerful, Higher-level Dashboard, APIs & SDKs to better facilitate digital products, services & orders beyond the underlying transactions
- Can be used to power all business- and pricing models under the sun.

**Cons**:
- Less flexibility & control in terms of advanced business- and pricing models.
- Higher fees per payment

### Go with a PSP if...
- You're comfortable & prefer absolute control with low-level APIs.
- You're looking for the lowest fees possible.
- You want to register & file for international taxes yourself.

### Go with Polar if...
- You want product-, customer-, order- and subscription management via an intuitive and easy dashboard
- You want to offer file downloads, license keys, Discord- and/or private GitHub repository invites with ease - with more built-in automations to come.
- You prefer a more high-level API optimized for making monetization easier.
- You want us to handle international taxes for you

### International Sales Tax - Capturing
"Charging the Swedish consumer $12.5/month and saving $2.5/month for the Swedish tax authorities. Stripe Tax is an excellent service to automate this and the one Polar uses today."

### International Sales Tax - Remitting
"Filing & paying the captured sales taxes with the tax authorities on time. Stripe Tax does not do this, i.e the merchant is liable to register, file and pay taxes to local tax authorities."

### Tax Compliance Notes
"Many jurisdictions, however, don't require this until you reach a certain threshold in terms of sales volume. But others require registration even before the first sale - or after a very low threshold."

"In short: It's complex and hard. Even large and well-known businesses don't do it perfectly. Arguably, it's almost impossible and at least highly impracticle and expensive to comply perfectly upfront."

### With Polar (MoR)
- We are liable for all of the above as your reseller.
- Offer EU VAT for B2B sales (expected and desired within EU for businesses) without having to register, capture and remit it yourself.
- Sales taxes would be added for more customers vs. with you selling directly (Cons)
- You cannot leverage inbound VAT towards VAT expense deductions yourself (Cons)

## Why Polar Resource Page
- **Title**: "Why Polar is the best way to monetize your software"

### Table of Contents
- Introduction
- Merchant of Record
- Developer Experience
- Pricing
- Why switch to Polar?
- Who else is switching?

### Introduction
"Monetizing your software should be easy."
"Polar is an open-source billing infrastructure platform designed specifically for developers who want to monetize their software without the complexity of traditional payment systems."

### Merchant of Record Section
"Leave billing infrastructure and international tax headaches to us."

**Features**:
- We handle VAT, GST, and sales tax in all jurisdictions
- EU VAT handling - Proper B2B reverse charge and B2C tax collection
- Automatic tax calculation - Real-time tax rates for every transaction

### Developer Experience
- **Developer Ergonomics**: "We design our APIs & SDKs with developer ergonomics in mind. We put the developer experience in the front seat."
- **Developer Tools**: "We build developer tools that make it easy to iterate quickly and maintain systems effectively. We're not just building a billing system, we're building a platform that enables you to build your business."
- **Open Source**: "Polar is open source, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. We believe that the best way to build a great developer experience is to build it with the community."

### Pricing
- **Cheapest MoR on the market**: "Polar is priced 20% cheaper than other MoR alternatives. 4% and 40¢ per transaction."
- **No Hidden Fees**: "While payouts may incur fees charged by the payout providers (such as Stripe), Polar does not add any extra fees or markup."

### Why Switch to Polar?
- **Integrate with 6 lines of code**: "We've gone the extra mile to build ergonomic adapters that plugs right into the most popular frameworks. If that isn't enough, our versatile SDKs allow you to integrate with Polar in any way you want."
- **Secure, robust & reliable payments**: "You can rest assured that your customers will be able to pay you securely and reliably. We've built a payment system that works for you, not against you."
- **We're deeply invested in your success**: "Polar is built by developers, for developers. We listen to your feedback, and we're always looking for ways to make it easier for you to succeed. We care."

### Who else is switching?
"Trusted by leading SaaS companies"
"Companies like Tailwind Labs, Midday, Stilla AI & thousands of other SaaS companies have already made the switch to Polar."

### FAQs

**Q: Do I still pay Stripe fees if I use Polar?**
A: "Polar covers Stripe's 2.9% + 30¢ from our 4% + 40¢. Stripe's additional fees, like +1.5% for international cards, are passed through at cost."

**Q: Is Polar built on Stripe? Why not just use Stripe directly?**
A: "We use Stripe rails for processing reliability and coverage. Processing ≠ the business layer. Polar is the MoR + billing + entitlements + unit-economics layer you'd otherwise build or buy on top of Stripe."

**Q: How are payouts handled internationally?**
A: "All payments are made to Polar as the Merchant of Record. We use Stripe Connect Express to make payouts across more countries than Stripe Payments supports directly."

**Q: Do you handle EU VAT reverse charge for B2B?**
A: "Yes, EU B2B reverse charge is handled correctly under our MoR model, ensuring compliance with EU tax regulations."

**Q: What about lock-in? Can I leave later?**
A: "We deliberately architect for continuity (Stripe on the inside) and provide import/export plus migration tooling, so you always retain a pragmatic exit path."

**Q: What happens during account reviews or disputes?**
A: "We run standard MoR/KYC reviews (typically within a week) and follow card-network norms: disputes cost $15 and gateway fees aren't refunded on refunds."

"While Stripe is a powerful payment processor, Polar is a complete billing infrastructure platform built specifically for developers who want to monetize software. The key difference: Polar acts as a Merchant of Record, handling all tax compliance globally, while Stripe is a payment processor that leaves tax compliance to you."

## Pricing Page (Detailed)
- **Title**: "Pricing"

### Introduction
- **Heading 1**: "Cheapest MoR on the market"
- "Polar is priced 20% cheaper than other MoR alternatives. 4% and 40¢ per transaction."
- **Heading 2**: "No Hidden Fees"
- "While payouts may incur fees charged by the payout providers (such as Stripe), Polar does not add any extra fees or markup."

### Transaction Fees
**Heading**: "4% + 40¢ per transaction"
"Polar is currently built on Stripe, and we cover their 2.9% + 30¢ fee from ours. However, they impose a few additional fees for certain transactions that we need to pass on."

### Additional Fees
- +1.5% for international cards (non-US)
- +0.5% for subscription payments

**Note**: "We also reserve the right to pass on any other fees Stripe might impose in the future"

### Example Breakdown
"Let's look at an example breakdown with all these additional fees applied. Below is a payment of a $30 subscription from Sweden (25% VAT)."

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Product Price | $30 |
| VAT (25%) | $7.5 |
| Total Transaction Value | $37.5 |
| Transaction Fee (4% + 40¢) | $1.9 |
| International Card (+1.5%) | $0.56 |
| Subscription (+0.5%) | $0.19 |
| **Total Fees (Before Payout)** | **$2.65** |

### Refunds
"You can issue both full or partial refunds on Polar to your customers. However, the initial transaction fees are not refunded to you since credit card networks and PSPs charge them regardless of a future refund."

**Note**: "Polar reserves the right to issue refunds at our own discretion up to 60 days after the purchase as part of our efforts to continuously and proactively reduce disputes & chargebacks which costs you $15/dispute. We only leverage this right for this purpose and in the interest of reducing chargebacks and fees for you."

### Dispute/Chargeback Fees
"Sometimes, customers can open a dispute/chargeback via their bank for a purchase. Disputes cost $15 per dispute regardless of outcome and is deducted from your balance directly. This fee is charged by the underlying credit card networks & PSPs regardless of outcome and therefore something we cannot refund."

"However, we continuously work to proactively reduce the rate of chargebacks across Polar to be at or lower than industry standards."

"Credit card networks impose monitoring programs, penalties and higher chargeback costs for sellers with high chargeback rates (~0.7%+). Since Polar is the Merchant of Record, we therefore always monitor and proactively prevent our rate coming close to these thresholds."

**Note**: "Therefore, we might need to intervene and even suspend your account unless swift and proactive measures are taken to reduce chargebacks to an acceptable industry standard."

### Payout Fees
"While payouts may incur fees charged by the payout providers (such as Stripe), Polar does not add any extra fees or markup. These are strictly the provider's fees, and Polar does not profit from them."

"In addition, Polar offers manual withdrawals for developers. Keeping you in control of when to issue payouts."

**Note**: "Unless you have a Polar balance that you haven't withdrawn for several months, at which point we'll eventually need to trigger a payout on your behalf."

**Stripe fees**:
- $2 per month of active payout(s)
- 0.25% + $0.25 per payout
- Cross border fees (currency conversion): 0.25% (EU) - 1% in other countries

**Open Collective fees**:
- 10% on amount transferred
